                    He is an unorthodox batsman in the sense that much of his batting technique defies the coaching manuals. Dhoni doesn't have a great footwork. He believes in muscling a full ball to Long-on, Long-off
                    or Midwicket regions rather than driving it to the Cover region. Not only a smasher of the full length balls, he also is a firm puller and hooker 
                    of the short balls, which makes it tough for the bowler to bowl to him. He holds the bat firmly at the bottom of the handle and tries to hit the 
                    ball hard and flat to clear the boundary. Yet, he manages to hit long sixes at times.
