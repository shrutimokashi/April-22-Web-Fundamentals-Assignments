            Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private 
            network).Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

            markup and coding.Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available 
            with basic technical skills.Web development includes many types of web content creation. Some examples include hand coding 
            web pages in a text editor, building a website in a program like Dreamweaver, and updating a blog via a blogging website.
