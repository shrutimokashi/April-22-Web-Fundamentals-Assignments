        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, allows web users to create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links using elements, 
           tags,and attributes. However, it is worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can not create 
           dynamic functionality.The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, 
           and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
           HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content
           so that internet users can view it.All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. 
           HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas 
           an attribute describes the characteristics of an element.The first version of HTML consisted of 18 tags. Since then, each
           new version came with new tags and attributes added to the markup. The most significant upgrade of the language so far was 
           the introduction of HTML5 in 2014.The main difference between HTML and HTML5 is that HTML5 supports new kinds of form 
           controls.
        </p>
        <p>
           Using HTML, a text file is further marked up with additional text describing how the document should be displayed. To keep 
           the markup separate from the actual content of the HTML file, there is a special, distinguishing HTML syntax that is used. 
           These special components are known as HTML tags. The tags can contain name-value pairs known as attributes, and a piece of 
           content that is enclosed within a tag is referred to as an HTML element.
        </p>
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>
           Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making 
           web pages presentable.CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, 
           the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors 
           are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.
        </p>
        <p>
           With CSS we can play with the images and animation.The page layout, animation and quality of images make the first impact 
           before the content catches a viewer attention.The Image filters are easily available on CSS and we can do that right here,
           without having to work or taking help from any other software.With CSS we can make better backgrounds. So backgrounds not
           any more need to be boring and static. Previously, we needed some additional programming and scripting, but now this can 
           easily be done with CSS3.
        </p>
        <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
        <p>
           JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, 
           whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted 
           programming language with object-oriented capabilities.JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button 
           clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.
        </p>
        <p>
           JavaScript is what is known as a client-side script. Most Web applications, such as a search engine, work because of an 
           interaction between the user's device (e.g. computer, phone or tablet) and a remote server. The software on the remote 
           server sends information to the client (i.e. the user's machine) and the software on the client side reads the information 
           and renders a Web page on screen.A client-side script is a programming language that performs its tasks entirely on the 
           client's machine and does not need to interact with the server to function. 
        </p>
        <p>
           JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented language. Objects are created programmatically in 
           JavaScript, by attaching methods and properties to otherwise empty objects at run time, as opposed to the syntactic class 
           definitions common in compiled languages like C++ and Java. Once an object has been constructed it can be used as a 
           blueprint (or prototype) for creating similar objects.
        </p>
        <p>
           JavaScript is versatile enough to be used for a variety of different applications, like software, hardware controls, and servers. 
           JavaScript is most known for being a web-based language, because it's native to the web browser. The web browser can naturally 
           understand the language, like how a native English speaker can naturally understand English.
